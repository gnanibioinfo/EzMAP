# EzMAP : Easy Microbiome Analysis Platform
We introduce a user-friendly microbiome analysis pipeline named as EzMAP (Easy Microbiome Analysis Platform), developed using Java Swings, Java Script and R programming. 
This platform is provided with functionalities for metadata profiling, read pre-processing, sequence processing and classification, OTU (operational taxonomic unit) clustering, 
taxonomy assignment and visualization. Most of the microbial community profiling are implemented by using QIIME2 (Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology) functionalities.
